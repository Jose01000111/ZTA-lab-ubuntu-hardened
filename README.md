### Introduction
#### Iâ€™m doing this lab to test Linuxâ€™s power and flexibility by tackling a real-world scenario. Our company, Redwood Civic Technologies, a government contractor, had its California data center taken offline by wildfires. We had to activate our warm site in Virginia and quickly rebuild a critical system with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) to meet government security requirements.

#### -Government requirements include:

####  -Strict Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)

  #### -Least-privilege access

####   -Strong identity verification

This lab lets me build a hardened Ubuntu server, create a ZTA-compliant environment, and onboard disaster recovery users securelyâ€”helping me grow my skills creatively and practically.
